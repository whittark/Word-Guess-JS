# A GOREY WORD GUESSING GAME

### ABOUT THE GAME

 In 1963, prolific illustrator and author Edward Gorey (February 22, 1925â€“April 15, 2000) published a darkly humorous alphabet book featuring children meeting terrible fates, often due to stunningly bad choices. 

 In "A Gorey Word Guessing Game," press letter keys to spell one of the fates of the Ghastlycrumb Tinies.

 Example: In the original publication, "B is for Basil assaulted by Bears." The game word for Basil is "Bears."
 Select letter keys to guess the word correctly; you get 10 tries to win.
